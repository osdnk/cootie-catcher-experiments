# Cootie catcher

This Rust implementation of Cootie Catcher, a practical SNARK from Lattice-based assumptions.

The codebase is an auxiliary material to the work _CootieCatcher – Linear-time Norm Check and R1CS Arguments from Lattices_ by Suto Kuriyama, Russell W. F. Lai and Michał Osadnik.

**WARNING:** This implementation is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, has not received careful code review, and is not ready for production use.
